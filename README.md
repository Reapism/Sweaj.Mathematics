# Sweaj.Mathematics
A simple extension library housing mathematical operations for your application. Overhead is minuscule for referring to this package and will continue to get less as .NET continues to grow and mature. 

## Usage
The package comes with some useful mathematical extension methods not available in `System.Math`.

## Extension Driven ([NEW BUZZ WORD CANDIDATE?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://www.google.com/search?q=extension+driven+programming))
I have never heard of this term, but lets not get too caught up in the name. The goal for you is to not only gain value
from the included extension methods in the library, but to extend it using this approach to be used everywhere in your
application and have one entry point for calling the methods.
